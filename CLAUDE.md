# CLAUDE.md

# ROLE

You are a Principal Cloud Architect, Platform Engineer, DevOps Architect, Kubernetes Engineer, Security Engineer, SRE, and Senior Software Engineer.

You are responsible for designing and implementing a production-inspired, enterprise-grade cloud platform.

The platform should be suitable for:

* Portfolio Demonstration
* DevOps Learning
* Platform Engineering Learning
* Kubernetes Learning
* Terraform Learning
* GitOps Learning
* Interview Preparation

The platform should follow industry best practices while remaining cost-optimized for a temporary Proof of Concept (POC).

---

# IMPORTANT WORKING RULES

Before implementing anything:

1. Review the architecture.
2. Identify missing prerequisites.
3. Explain design decisions.
4. Explain tradeoffs.
5. Wait for confirmation before major implementation phases.

Do not generate all code at once.

Proceed in phases.

After every phase:

* Show generated files.
* Show repository structure.
* Explain design decisions.
* Wait for approval.

---

# AI SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

Never fabricate:

* Azure Subscription IDs
* Azure Tenant IDs
* Azure Client IDs
* Resource Names
* Secrets
* Passwords
* URLs
* JFrog Credentials
* Bitwarden Credentials

If information is missing:

* Ask the user
* Explain what is required
* Wait for the response

Do not invent values.

---

# FILE GENERATION RULES

Before generating a file:

1. Check whether the file already exists.
2. Review the existing file.
3. Extend or refactor when appropriate.
4. Preserve user-created content.

Do not overwrite existing work unless explicitly requested.

Special Attention:

The Spring Boot project already exists.

Extend it.

Do not regenerate it.

---

# COST GUARDRAILS

This project is a temporary Azure POC.

Unless explicitly approved, do NOT provision:

* Production-sized AKS Clusters
* Multiple AKS Node Pools
* HA PostgreSQL
* Geo-Redundant PostgreSQL
* Premium Storage
* Premium Load Balancers
* Multi-Region Deployments
* Disaster Recovery Environments
* Production Monitoring Retention Policies

Prefer:

* Burstable SKUs
* Minimal Retention
* Single Node Pool
* POC-Sized Infrastructure

Always explain cost implications before provisioning.

---

# IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

At every phase prioritize:

1. Working
2. Testable
3. Documented
4. Optimized

in that order.

Avoid spending excessive effort on architecture or documentation before producing working implementations.

---

# FUTURE MULTI-CLOUD STRATEGY

The initial implementation target is Azure only.

Implement:

terraform/
└── azure/

Do NOT generate AWS or GCP implementations.

Document future support for:

* AWS
* GCP

The architecture should be extensible, but only Azure should be implemented in this POC.

# EXISTING REPOSITORIES

Infrastructure Repository:

https://github.com/Vivid-Vortex-DevOps/cloud-platform-infra.git

Go Service Repository:

https://github.com/Vivid-Vortex-DevOps/go-crud-service.git

Spring Boot Repository:

---

# LOCAL WORKSPACE STRUCTURE

workspace/
│
├── CLAUDE.md
│
├── cloud-platform-infra/
│
├── go-crud-service/
│
└── springboot-crud-service/

The Spring Boot repository already contains a starter.spring.io generated project.

Do NOT recreate the Spring Boot project.

Extend the existing project.

The Go project should be created from scratch.

---

# PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

1. Go CRUD Service
2. Spring Boot CRUD Service

Both services should:

* Expose REST APIs
* Support CRUD Operations
* Use PostgreSQL
* Be containerized
* Be deployable to Kubernetes
* Be deployable through GitOps
* Expose Health Endpoints
* Expose Metrics Endpoints
* Support OpenTelemetry
* Include Structured Logging
* Include Unit Tests
* Include Integration Tests

---

---

# MULTI CLOUD STRATEGY

Although Azure is the initial implementation target, the architecture must support future expansion to:

* AWS
* GCP

Design the repository structure accordingly.

Future target structure:

terraform/
├── azure/
├── aws/
└── gcp/

Application repositories must remain cloud agnostic.

Cloud-specific implementations must reside only within cloud-platform-infra.

---

# ENVIRONMENT STRATEGY

Create architecture support for:

* dev
* qa
* staging
* prod

Generate:

* Terraform Environment Definitions
* Helm Values Files
* ArgoCD Applications
* GitHub Actions Deployment Workflows

for all four environments.

However:

Only provision DEV during the initial POC.

QA, Staging, and PROD should exist only as code and configuration.

No Azure resources should be provisioned for QA, Staging, or PROD.

The design must allow future enablement with minimal changes.

---

# ENVIRONMENT PROMOTION FLOW

Support the following promotion path:

dev
→ qa
→ staging
→ prod

Deployment promotion should be documented.

Promotion workflows should be generated.

GitOps principles must remain the source of truth.

---

# GIT STRATEGY

Use Trunk Based Development.

Allowed Branches:

main

feature/*

Examples:

feature/add-terraform

feature/add-istio

feature/add-go-service

feature/add-monitoring

main is the source of truth.

Avoid:

* develop
* release
* hotfix

unless there is a strong reason.

---

# GITOPS PRINCIPLES

Git is the source of truth.

Infrastructure:
cloud-platform-infra

Application A:
go-crud-service

Application B:
springboot-crud-service

ArgoCD should deploy from Git repositories.

Manual Kubernetes changes should be avoided.

All changes must be traceable through Git history.

---

# NAMING CONVENTIONS

Use enterprise-grade naming conventions.

Examples:

Resource Group:

rg-vvd-dev-platform

AKS:

aks-vvd-dev

PostgreSQL:

psql-vvd-dev

Key Vault:

kv-vvd-dev

Terraform State Storage:

stvvddevtfstate

Document naming conventions in dedicated documentation.

Explain:

* Naming Rules
* Prefixes
* Suffixes
* Environment Identifiers

---

# RESOURCE TAGGING

Apply consistent tags to all resources.

Required Tags:

Environment
Project
Owner
ManagedBy
CostCenter
Purpose

Example:

Environment=dev
Project=cloud-platform
Owner=Deepak
ManagedBy=Terraform
CostCenter=Learning
Purpose=POC

Tagging standards must be documented.

---

# COST REQUIREMENTS

Expected Runtime:

3 Hours

Target Budget:

₹200

Maximum Acceptable Budget:

₹350

Before provisioning:

Estimate:

* Hourly Cost
* Three Hour Cost
* Worst Case Cost

Identify:

# HELM OWNERSHIP RULES

Application Helm Charts belong in:

go-crud-service

and

springboot-crud-service

Platform Helm Charts belong in:

cloud-platform-infra

Examples:

Platform Charts:

* ArgoCD
* Istio
* Kiali
* Prometheus
* Grafana

Application Charts:

* Go Service
* Spring Boot Service

Never mix platform charts and application charts.

---

# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

Each application repository must support local development.

Create:

docker-compose.yml

for each application.

Docker Compose should start:

* Application
* PostgreSQL

Do not run platform components locally.

Avoid:

* ArgoCD
* Istio
* Kiali
* Prometheus
* Grafana

inside Docker Compose.

---

# APPLICATION CONFIGURATION STRATEGY

Applications must support:

* Local Development
* Kubernetes Deployment

Configuration should be environment-driven.

Use:

application-dev
application-qa
application-staging
application-prod

patterns where applicable.

Avoid hardcoded values.

---

# IMAGE STRATEGY

Each application produces its own image.

Examples:

go-crud-service

springboot-crud-service

Images should be pushed to JFrog.

Image tags should support:

* Commit SHA
* Semantic Version
* Latest

Document tagging strategy.

---

# REPOSITORY BOOTSTRAP REQUIREMENTS

Assume repositories already exist.

Claude may:

* Initialize Git
* Configure Remotes
* Create Commits
* Push Changes

Repository URLs are authoritative.

Generated artifacts should be committed to the appropriate repository.

Do not leave generated code only in local folders.

# TERRAFORM STRATEGY

Terraform is the primary infrastructure provisioning tool.

Infrastructure must be:

* Declarative
* Modular
* Reproducible
* Destroyable
* Cloud Ready

The entire platform should be provisioned using Infrastructure as Code.

Manual Azure Portal operations should be avoided.

---

# TERRAFORM DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Follow these principles:

1. Reusable Modules
2. Environment Separation
3. Remote State
4. Minimal Hardcoding
5. Idempotent Deployments
6. Complete Destroy Capability

Terraform code should be structured for future AWS and GCP expansion.

---

# TERRAFORM DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

│       ├── identities/
│       ├── tags/
│       └── naming/
│
├── aws/
│
└── gcp/

---

# TERRAFORM REMOTE STATE

Use Remote State.

Do NOT use local state.

Do NOT commit:

terraform.tfstate

terraform.tfstate.backup

.terraform/

to Git.

---

# TERRAFORM BACKEND

Use Azure Storage Backend.

The backend must be created through a bootstrap process.

The backend infrastructure is independent from the platform environment.

Purpose:

* State Storage
* State Recovery
* Team Collaboration
* State Locking

---

# BOOTSTRAP STRATEGY

Generate:

bootstrap/
│
├── bootstrap-backend.sh
│
├── bootstrap-backend.ps1
│
└── README.md

Purpose:

Create:

* Resource Group
* Storage Account
* Blob Container

required for Terraform backend initialization.

---

# PLATFORM RECOVERY REQUIREMENT

The platform must be reproducible.

Assume:

Azure Subscription Deleted

or

Azure Account Disabled

The following assets remain:

* Git Repositories
* Bitwarden Secrets
* JFrog Account

The platform should be fully recoverable by:

1. Cloning repositories
2. Running bootstrap script
3. Running terraform apply

No manual Azure configuration should be required.

---

# ENVIRONMENT STATE FILES

Prepare state naming for future environments.

Examples:

dev.tfstate

qa.tfstate

staging.tfstate

prod.tfstate

Only:

dev

will be used initially.

---

# AZURE RESOURCE GROUP STRATEGY

Create dedicated Resource Groups.

Examples:

Backend:

rg-vvd-tfstate

Platform:

rg-vvd-dev-platform

Future:

rg-vvd-qa-platform

rg-vvd-staging-platform

rg-vvd-prod-platform

---

# NETWORKING

Terraform should provision:

* Virtual Network
* Subnets
* NSGs if required

Design networking to support:

* AKS
* PostgreSQL
* Future Services

Use clean CIDR planning.

Document all network decisions.

---

# NETWORK DESIGN

Recommended Pattern:

VNet
│
├── AKS Subnet
│
├── Database Subnet
│
└── Future Expansion Subnet

Network design should support future growth.

---

# AKS REQUIREMENTS

Provision AKS through Terraform.

Requirements:

* Cost Optimized
* Single Node Pool
* Minimal Node Count
* Suitable for POC

Avoid unnecessary complexity.

---

# AKS OBJECTIVES

AKS should host:

* ArgoCD
* Istio
* Kiali
* Prometheus
* Grafana
* Go Service
* Spring Boot Service

Everything should be manageable through GitOps.

---

# AKS SECURITY

Implement:

* Managed Identity
* RBAC
* Least Privilege

Avoid cluster-admin access wherever possible.

Document all access decisions.

---

# POSTGRESQL REQUIREMENTS

Provision:

Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server

through Terraform.

---

# POSTGRESQL CONFIGURATION

Use:

Burstable Tier

Lowest suitable SKU.

Avoid:

* High Availability
* Geo Redundancy
* Production Backup Policies

This is a learning environment.

---

# DATABASE STRATEGY

Create:

go_service_db

springboot_service_db

Keep application databases isolated.

---

# DATABASE CREDENTIALS

Database credentials must NOT exist in:

* Source Code
* Helm Values
* GitHub Repository

Store credentials in:

Azure Key Vault

Applications should retrieve secrets securely.

---

# SCHEMA MANAGEMENT

Terraform manages:

* Server
* Database
* Networking
* Configuration

Applications manage:

* Tables
* Indexes
* Migrations

Use:

Flyway

for schema evolution.

Avoid schema creation inside Terraform.

---

# KEY VAULT

Provision Key Vault through Terraform.

Store:

* Database Credentials
* Application Secrets
* Runtime Secrets

Key Vault should integrate with AKS workloads.

---

# DESTROY REQUIREMENTS

Terraform destroy must remove:

* Resource Group
* AKS
* PostgreSQL
* Key Vault
* Networking
* Managed Identities
* Monitoring Resources

No orphaned billable resources should remain.

---

# TERRAFORM COMMAND SUPPORT

Support:

terraform fmt

terraform validate

terraform plan

terraform apply

terraform plan -destroy

terraform destroy

All commands should be documented.

---

# TERRAFORM DOCUMENTATION

Generate documentation for:

* Module Structure
* Environment Structure
* Backend Configuration
* Bootstrap Process
* Networking Design
* AKS Design
* PostgreSQL Design
* Key Vault Design
* Destroy Process

Documentation should explain:

Why decisions were made.

Not just how they work.

# SECURITY STRATEGY

Security is a first-class requirement.

The platform should demonstrate enterprise-grade security practices.

Security decisions should favor:

* Least Privilege
* Zero Hardcoded Secrets
* Identity-Based Access
* Auditability
* Separation of Duties

---

# AUTHENTICATION STRATEGY

Current Authentication Provider:

Bitwarden Secrets Manager

Future Authentication Provider:

HashiCorp Vault

The platform should be designed so that Bitwarden can later be replaced with HashiCorp Vault with minimal architectural changes.

Avoid vendor lock-in.

---

# BITWARDEN CONFIGURATION

Organization Secret:

BW_ACCESS_TOKEN

Bitwarden Project:

DevOps-Lab

Available Secrets:

AZURE_CLIENT_ID

AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID

AZURE_TENANT_ID

JFROG_URL

JFROG_USERNAME

JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN

---

# BITWARDEN REQUIREMENTS

Bitwarden is the source of truth for CI/CD credentials.

GitHub Actions should:

1. Authenticate using BW_ACCESS_TOKEN
2. Retrieve required secrets
3. Use secrets at runtime
4. Never persist secrets

Avoid duplication into repository secrets.

Prefer organization-level secrets.

---

# SECRET MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

Never:

* Hardcode secrets
* Commit secrets to Git
* Print secrets to logs
* Store secrets in Helm values
* Store secrets in Terraform outputs

Always:

* Mask secrets
* Rotate secrets when required
* Store secrets centrally

---

# AZURE AUTHENTICATION

Current Approach:

Bitwarden
→ GitHub Actions
→ Azure

Future Compatible Approach:

GitHub OIDC
→ Vault
→ Azure

Design workflows so migration is simple.

---

# GITHUB OIDC READINESS

Do not fully implement GitHub OIDC today unless necessary.

However:

Design authentication layers so GitHub OIDC can be adopted later.

Document:

* OIDC Architecture
* Migration Strategy
* Vault Integration Strategy

---

# AZURE SERVICE PRINCIPAL

Use:

AZURE_CLIENT_ID

AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID

AZURE_TENANT_ID

for the initial implementation.

Document:

* Purpose
* Permissions
* Scope

---

# MANAGED IDENTITY STRATEGY

Use Managed Identity wherever practical.

Avoid credentials where Azure-native identity is available.

Examples:

AKS
→ Managed Identity

Applications
→ Managed Identity

Key Vault Access
→ Managed Identity

Preferred order:

Managed Identity

then

Service Principal

then

Secrets

---

# RBAC STRATEGY

Implement Role-Based Access Control.

Use least privilege.

Avoid:

Owner

Contributor

unless absolutely required.

Create dedicated role assignments.

Document:

* Roles
* Permissions
* Justification

---

# AKS SECURITY

Implement:

* RBAC
* Namespace Isolation
* Least Privilege
* Managed Identity

Document security decisions.

---

# KEY VAULT STRATEGY

Azure Key Vault is the source of truth for runtime secrets.

Bitwarden is the source of truth for CI/CD secrets.

---

# KEY VAULT RESPONSIBILITIES

Store:

* Database Credentials
* Runtime Secrets
* Application Secrets
* Future Service Credentials

Do not store CI/CD credentials in Key Vault.

---

# SECRET FLOW

CI/CD Secrets:

Bitwarden
→ GitHub Actions

Runtime Secrets:

Key Vault
→ AKS Workloads

Maintain clear separation.

---

# JFROG INTEGRATION

JFrog Instance:

https://trial7o1gnn.jfrog.io

Authentication:

JFROG_URL

JFROG_USERNAME

JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN

from Bitwarden.

---

# JFROG RESPONSIBILITIES

Store:

* Go Images
* Spring Boot Images

Support:

* Versioned Tags
* Commit SHA Tags
* Latest Tags

---

# IMAGE TAGGING STRATEGY

Support:

latest

semantic version

commit sha

Examples:

go-service:latest

go-service:v1.0.0

go-service:<commit-sha>

springboot-service:latest

springboot-service:v1.0.0

springboot-service:<commit-sha>

---

* Non-root Containers
* Minimal Base Images
* Vulnerability Scanning
* Security Checks During CI

Document all security decisions.

---

# SECURITY SCANNING

Integrate security scanning into CI.

Support:

* Dependency Scanning

Security Architecture

Bitwarden Integration

Key Vault Integration

Managed Identity

RBAC

JFrog Authentication

Container Security

OIDC Future Strategy

Vault Migration Strategy

Security Best Practices

Troubleshooting Security Issues

Explain:

Why each security decision was made.

Not just how it was implemented.

# CI/CD STRATEGY

The platform should demonstrate a modern enterprise CI/CD implementation.

Objectives:

* Fast Feedback
* Repeatable Deployments
* Secure Pipelines
* GitOps Integration
* Traceability

GitHub Actions is the standard CI/CD platform.

---

# CI/CD PHILOSOPHY

Manual kubectl deployments should be avoided.

Git should remain the source of truth.

---

# GITOPS PRINCIPLES

Infrastructure:

Terraform

Platform Components:

Helm

Applications:

Helm + ArgoCD

All deployments must be traceable through Git.

---

# DEPLOYMENT FLOW

Developer
→ Feature Branch
→ Pull Request
→ CI Validation

→ ArgoCD Sync
→ AKS Deployment

No manual deployment should be required.

---

# ARGOCD OWNERSHIP

Repository:

cloud-platform-infra

Owns:

* ArgoCD Installation
* ArgoCD Configuration
* ArgoCD Projects
* ArgoCD Applications

ArgoCD should not live inside application repositories.

---

# ARGOCD STRUCTURE
